## Master Bash #
This is a repo I set up to work through the examples in the book
"Mastering Linux Schell Scripting - Second Edition" by Mokhtar Ebrahim and
Andrew Mallet
([ISBN: 9781788990554](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-linux-shell-scripting-second-edition/9781788990554))

I've separated the work by chapter, removed comments where I didn't feel they
were needed, and updated code to work with installed versions of certain apps
on MacOS, as they don't always support the same args and options as the Linux
versions.
